# Reimbursement Ticketing System

A ticketing system for employees to add reimbursement requests, and then for managers to view pending requests and
either approve or deny them.

Users need to first register a new account. Both username and password are required. Users can select to either be an
employee or manager, but the default is to be an employee. Then users need to log in.

If users are employees, they can view a list of their previously submitted tickets. Employees can submit a new request
for reimbursement, by providing an amount and description.

If users are managers, they will be able to see a list of all submitted tickets. The list will be filterable by at least
the statuses of the tickets. Managers can either approve or deny each one.
