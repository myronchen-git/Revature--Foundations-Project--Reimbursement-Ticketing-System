# Reimbursement Ticketing System

A ticketing system for employees to add reimbursement requests, and then for managers to view pending requests and
either approve or deny them.

Users need to first register a new account. Both username and password are required. New users' roles are set to
employee; this can only be changed by a manager. Then users need to log in.

If users are employees, they can view a list of their previously submitted tickets. Employees can submit a new request
for reimbursement, by providing an amount and description.

If users are managers, they will be able to see a list of all submitted tickets. The list will be filterable by at least
the statuses of the tickets. Managers can either approve or deny each one.
